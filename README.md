# Codin

This is my hobby C Compiler project written in Odin!

I always wanted to build a C Compiler so this is it.

It's not finished and even if it was, it wouldn't be good, but that's not the goal of this project.

## Dependencies
- Odin
- Fasm

## Highest level code we can compile
```c
int main(void) {
    return (3 + 2) == (3 < 2) >= 5 * 2 / 2 != 0;
}
```
