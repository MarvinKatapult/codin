# Codin

This is my hobby C Compiler project written in Odin!

I always wanted to build a C Compiler so this is it.

It's not finished and even if it was, it wouldn't be good, but that's not the goal of this project.

## Dependencies
- Odin
- Fasm

## Highest level code we can compile
```c
int main(void) {
    int a = (3 - 2) * 2;
    int b = a * 5;
    return a == b < 5;
}
```
